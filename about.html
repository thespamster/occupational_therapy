        <p>I have been working as an occupational therapist for over 34 years and my career has spanned a diverse range of settings,
          reflecting my commitment to enhancing the well-being and functional capabilities of individuals across various life stages
          and circumstances. My goal whether working with individuals, families, organizations or companies, is to promote well-being,
          resilience, and optimal functioning.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I've worked with both adults and adolescents with a range of mental health conditions and with many children experiencing developmental and sensory challenges. 
          My experience extends beyond clinical settings into the corporate world, where I have worked with companies and individuals to manage sick leave, incapacity in
          the workplace, return to work programmes, workplace accommodations/adaptations with a focus on mental health. I have also worked extensively within the insurance
          industry, assessing employee benefit disability claims. I am trained in the provision of psychiatric functional capacity evaluations and in mediation. </p>
